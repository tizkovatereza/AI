Shared Dependencies:

1. HTML Elements: The "index.html" file will contain all the HTML elements. These elements will have unique id names that will be used by the CSS files for styling. 

2. CSS Styling: The "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files will contain the CSS styles for the HTML elements. They will use the id names of the HTML elements to apply the styles.

3. Tailwind CSS: The "tailwind.css" file is a dependency for the "styles.css" file. It will contain the Tailwind CSS framework which will be used in the "styles.css" file for styling the HTML elements.

4. Linking CSS to HTML: The "index.html" file will have links to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. This allows the HTML elements to be styled using the CSS rules defined in these files.

5. Shared Variables: There might be shared variables in the CSS files for defining common styles such as color schemes, font styles, etc.

6. Media Queries: Both CSS files might contain media queries for responsive design. These media queries will use the same breakpoints to ensure consistency across the website.

7. Class Names: Both CSS files might use the same class names to style similar elements in the HTML file.

Note: As there is no JavaScript mentioned in the tech stack, there are no shared dependencies related to JavaScript functions, exported variables, data schemas, or message names.
