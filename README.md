Dashing through the code
On a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob tails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Chorus:
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way.
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Hacking until dawn,
Committing on the fly,
Pull requests they spawn,
Beneath the starry sky.
While I code away,
Debugging all in sight,
Git push origin,
And then we call it a night!

Chorus:
Jingle code, jingle code,
Jingle all the way.
Oh! what fun it is to push
To the repo far away, hey!
