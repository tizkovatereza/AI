# An Ode to Git

In a branch, quite discrete, I begin my feat,
With an `init` I start, so neat.
Add and commit, the changes I greet,
As I craft my code, oh so sweet!

With every keystroke, the features take shape,
Push and pull, the repository's cape.
Merge conflicts, a coder's bane,
Yet with Git, itâ€™s not in vain.

Fork and clone, to the code, I'm drawn,
Creating worlds, from dusk to dawn.
Bit by bit, the functions come alive,
In the digital forge, where creativity thrives.

So here's to Git, our silent guide,
Through repositories wide and tide.
Together we code, we build, we strive,
In the digital forge, where creativity thrives.
