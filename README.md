# A Programmer's Jingle Bells

Dashing through the code 
On a one-horse open sleigh 
Over the fields we go 
Laughing all the way :joy: :christmas_tree:
Bells on bob tails ring 
Making spirits bright 
What fun it is to laugh and sing 
A sleighing song tonight :musical_note: :bell:

Chorus:
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way. :bell: :santa:
Oh! what fun it is to ride 
In a one-horse open sleigh. :santa: :gift:

Hacking until dawn,
Committing on the fly,
Pull requests they spawn,
Beneath the starry sky. :night_with_stars: :comet:
While I code away,
Debugging all in sight, :male-detective: :bug:
Git push origin,
And then we call it a night! :sleeping: :zzz:

Chorus:
Jingle code, jingle code,
Jingle all the way.
Oh! what fun it is to push
To the repo far away, hey! :rocket: :star2:

:sparkles: :computer: :octocat:
